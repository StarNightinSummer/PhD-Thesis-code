# PhD-Thesis-code
# This is for the thesis code
# "ARMA2.R" is to calculate three kinds of variance in Section 2
# "wald test.R" is used for the Wald test, and "model checking g estimation ARMA(1,1).R" is used for model checking in Section 2
# "M1(1).txt" and "PPI(1).txt" are the data for the application in Section 2
# "application plot.R" is used for the plot of application data in Section 2
# "new final real data M1 of omitting mean with adaptive AIC.R" and "new final real data PPI of omitting mean with adaptive AIC.R" are used for application in Section 2

# "final functions.R" contains the functions we need in Section 3 and appendix
# "final run setting.R" includes the setting for simulations in Section 3 and Appendix
# "data.csv" is the data for the application in Section 3
# "final application run.R" is the setting for the application in Section 3
# "garch_mu.c", "garch_mu.dll", "garch_mu.o", "garch_ar.c", "garch_ar.dll", "garch_ar.o" are the C++ codes for for-loop iterations in the estimation in Section 3
# "p_match" is the function to construct parameter vectors and matrices in the estimation in Section 3
